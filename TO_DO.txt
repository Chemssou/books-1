Bugs
~~~~
3. Fix correct selection of book rating when going back in to edit a book.
4. The search by author input box isnt being cleared after use
6. Auto admin functionality requires a user to log in twice before it works

Fixed bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
1. Why are users intermittently shown as logged out on client side? Seems this only happens on "auto admin" first use. User needs to log off and log back on again before using.
2. Why is the /books api called twice when going into the detail of a book.
5. Make sure that the count by rating is ordered by rating value desc (not count desc)
